## A Repo for Python Training V &amp; VIII

### Python Training V

CAR training: Scraping websites and services using requests to save off the HTML files locally and then BeautifulSoup to extract the relevant information. And, finally, pickle, to efficiently store the dictionaries you've created. We'll attempt at scraping all https://daphnecaruanagalizia.com work from her website and further examples anybody wants to bring along.

### Python Training VIII

We'll use the Python libraries and modules pickle, os and pandas to read and analyse tens of thousands of files from the Swiss supreme court and turn them into structured data for our computers to work with. You'll find the files [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bo98o847jf07ooc/AACgEKoDnDPj26-1fkByHbrJa?dl=0).
